Code for agent-based simulations presented in:

**"How economic exchange can favour human genetic diversity"**

This repository contains the simulation scripts and analysis used in the above study.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository starts by defining the fitness function, which is then passed to the `evol_model` function from `Toolbox.jl` (in [`JuliassicPark.jl`](https://github.com/CedricPerret/JuliassicPark.jl)) along with simulation parameters. The code includes a variety of simulation scenarios, varying:
- Modes of exchange
- Values of `Ïƒ` and `Î±`
- Parameter sweeps over `Î·` and `Ïƒ`

The structure of the code mirrors how models are typically introduced in academic papers. It starts by defining the fitness function â€” which links individual traits to evolutionary success â€” followed by the components required to run the simulations.

**Note:** All relevant functions must be defined and loaded at the start of the script to ensure the simulations run correctly.

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

This project **requires functions defined in [`JuliassicPark.jl`](https://github.com/CedricPerret/JuliassicPark.jl)**. Make sure to clone and load that repository as part of your environment before running the simulations.
